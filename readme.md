# Java Ray Tracer


This is a small ray tracer written in Java. It was implemented in part by following this guide on
computer graphics. 
[Computer Graphics from scratch](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/raytracing.html).
It can render simple primatives like Spheres and Tris and supports simple point lighting as well as ambient lighting.
Additionally .obj files can be imported and rendered.
